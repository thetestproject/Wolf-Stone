Wolf-Stone is a Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold mod which brings the levels from Wolfenstein 3D into the Blake Stone game.

Place the MAPHEAD.BSP and MAPTEMP.BSP files into your Blakestone root directory and run the game.

The mod is a work in progress, and many at the moment only the first two levels work (crashes while loading level 3).
